# On-line Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Based on Tensor Sketch
# Background
Network traffic anomaly detection is critical for advanced network applications. However, network traffic monitoring data arrive in a streaming fashion and could be infinite, which makes the offline algorithms that attempt to store the entire stream monitoring data for analysis  not scalable. To well utilize the strong ability of tensor model, we use a tensor to represent the prior non-anomalous traffic matrices   and  propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework that can be used to detect anomalies in a streaming fashion by making only one pass over the data while utilizing limited storage. In the framework, we propose a succinct tensor sketch to maintain, in a streaming model, the subspace that can well represent all prior non-anomalous data detected. Using the subspace, anomalies in each new incoming traffic monitoring data can be quickly detected based on a simple outlier score calculation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach over other popular online anomaly detection algorithms.
# Prerequisite
We implemented our TS-AD in Matlab R2017b. Please configure the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB first (http://www.tensortoolbox.org/).
